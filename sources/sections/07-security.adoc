[[security]]
== Security Considerations

Applications using these properties need to be aware of the risks entailed in
using the URIs provided as values. See <<RFC3986>> for a discussion of the
security considerations relating to URIs.

[[privacy]]
== Privacy Considerations

Properties with a "URI" value type can expose their users to privacy leaks as
any network access of the URI data can be tracked. Clients SHOULD NOT
automatically download data referenced by the URI without explicit instruction
from users. This specification does not introduce any additional privacy
concerns beyond those described in <<RFC5545>>.
